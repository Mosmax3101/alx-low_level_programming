In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding bugs(defects or problem that prevent correct operation) withing computer programs,software or systems.
Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis,monitoring at the application or system level,memory dumps, and profiling.
Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers.
